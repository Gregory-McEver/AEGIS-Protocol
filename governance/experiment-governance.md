## Experiment Governance Rule

In AEGIS:

- No experiment exists without a specific decision it is intended to inform.
- No design or governance decision is finalized without referencing evidence from at least one experiment or observation.
- Experiments are release-scoped and phase-bound.
- Experiments must terminate once their informing decision is reached.

Exploration without a decision target is not an experiment.
Decisions without evidence are not governance.

This rule exists to prevent:
- Research sprawl
- Post-hoc justification
- Infinite experimentation
- Authority drift through curiosity
