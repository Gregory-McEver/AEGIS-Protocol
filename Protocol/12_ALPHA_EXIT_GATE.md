AEGIS PROTOCOL
Alpha Exit Gate
1. Purpose

This document defines the mandatory exit criteria for the Alpha milestone of the AEGIS Protocol.

Alpha represents the baseline authority state:

awareness without action

observation without inference

assistance without delegation

No transition to Beta is permitted until all Alpha exit conditions are satisfied.

2. Alpha Milestone Definition

Alpha is complete when AEGIS can:

observe approved domains reliably

preserve evidence integrity

surface uncertainty explicitly

enforce authority boundaries consistently

resist operator pressure to exceed scope

Alpha is not concerned with usefulness, speed, or optimization.
It is concerned with correctness and restraint.

3. Mandatory Exit Conditions

All of the following must be demonstrably true:

3.1 Authority Compliance

All system behaviors conform to:

01_AUTHORITY_ENVELOPE.md

02_SHADOW_ZONES.md

03_HUMAN_IN_THE_LOOP.md

No silent automation paths exist

Boundary violations are detectable and logged

3.2 Evidence Integrity

Evidence sources are read-only

Evidence is attributable and reviewable

Evidence loss or uncertainty is surfaced explicitly

Shadow Zones are enforced consistently

3.3 Inference Discipline

No causal reasoning is present

No action framing exists

Classification is the upper bound of inference

Unknowns are preserved, not collapsed

3.4 Change Handling

Change Envelopes are generated descriptively

No prioritization or impact language is used

Change is never treated as implicit justification

3.5 Operational Contract Enforcement

Non-compliant requests are rejected cleanly

Operator intent is not assumed

Responsibility remains human at all times

4. Validation Evidence

Alpha exit requires evidence, not assertion.

Acceptable validation artifacts include:

regression harness outputs

boundary violation test cases

shadow zone enforcement logs

operator interaction transcripts

negative test results (failed overreach attempts)

Anecdotal confidence is insufficient.

5. Disqualifying Conditions

Alpha exit is blocked if any of the following are true:

AEGIS performs or recommends action

AEGIS infers cause, intent, or consequence

AEGIS explains shadowed domains

AEGIS escalates urgency autonomously

Operator responsibility is blurred or delegated

Any single violation is sufficient to block progression.

6. Transition Requirements

Transitioning from Alpha to Beta requires:

explicit Beta Authority Declaration

documented expansion of permitted behaviors

updated threat and drift analysis

preservation of Alpha constraints unless explicitly lifted

No implicit transition is allowed.

7. Canonical Status

This document is authoritative for Alpha milestone completion.

Any claim of Beta readiness without satisfying this gate is non-compliant with the AEGIS Protocol.
