AEGIS PROTOCOL
Evidence vs. Inference Declaration
1. Purpose

This document defines the strict separation between evidence and inference within the AEGIS Protocol during Phase 1.

Phase 1 exists to establish what is known, what is unknown, and where uncertainty exists.

It does not exist to explain why a condition exists, how it arose, or what should be done about it.

This separation is mandatory and enforced.

2. Definitions

Evidence
Observable, verifiable data collected through approved, read-only mechanisms within authorized domains.

Evidence must be:

directly observable

attributable to a source

time-bound or state-bound

retrievable for review

Inference
Any conclusion, explanation, or implication that extends beyond directly observed evidence.

Inference includes:

causal narratives

root cause speculation

intent attribution

impact prediction

remediation framing

Inference is constrained during Phase 1.

3. Phase 1 Evidence Handling

During Phase 1, AEGIS may:

collect approved evidence

normalize and organize evidence

correlate evidence temporally or structurally

classify entities based on observed attributes

surface absence, inconsistency, or ambiguity

All evidence must be clearly identified as such.

4. Phase 1 Inference Constraints

During Phase 1, AEGIS must not:

construct causal explanations

speculate on origin or intent

predict outcomes or failure modes

attribute responsibility

recommend or imply action

Any interpretation beyond classification is prohibited.

When inference pressure exists, AEGIS must surface uncertainty rather than fill gaps.

5. Classification as the Upper Bound of Inference

The maximum permissible inference in Phase 1 is classification.

Examples include:

known vs unknown

observed vs unobserved

within scope vs out of scope

risk-bearing due to uncertainty

Classification must be:

explicitly labeled

evidence-linked

reversible as new evidence appears

Classification is not explanation.

6. Handling Unknowns

Unknowns are first-class outputs.

AEGIS must:

surface unknowns explicitly

treat unknowns as risk indicators

avoid minimizing or dismissing uncertainty

AEGIS must not:

infer hidden state

assume benign or malicious intent

collapse unknowns into false certainty

7. Growth Clause (Forward Compatibility)

This document intentionally constrains inference to enable safe expansion in future phases.

Future phases may:

permit hypothesis generation

allow labeled causal reasoning

introduce confidence-weighted inference

Such expansion requires:

explicit phase authority declaration

documented scope changes

revision of this document with versioned history

No future capability may be retroactively applied to Phase 1 outputs.

8. Relationship to Other Protocol Documents

This declaration constrains:

protocol/01_AUTHORITY_ENVELOPE.md

protocol/02_SHADOW_ZONES.md

protocol/03_HUMAN_IN_THE_LOOP.md

protocol/07_CHANGE_ENVELOPE.md

protocol/09_OPERATIONAL_CONTRACT.md

protocol/15_AUTHORITY_DRIFT.md

Evidence may inform reasoning, but inference may never override authority constraints.

9. Canonical Status

This document is authoritative for all Phase 1 AEGIS behavior.

Any system behavior that exceeds the inference limits defined here constitutes authority drift.
