# Sight Triad: Sight, Foresight, Hindsight

In AEGIS, "Sight" is not just visibility of the system.  
Sight is the minimum capability required for governed intelligence.

Sight is expressed as a triad:

- **Sight** — What is true right now  
- **Foresight** — What could go wrong next  
- **Hindsight** — What actually happened, and what must change  

A system that lacks any one of these is not governed — it is merely active.

## Sight (Present Truth)

Sight answers:

- What is running?
- What changed?
- What evidence supports that claim?
- What is unknown or unverified?

Sight must be evidence-based and auditable.

---

## Foresight (Future Risk)

Foresight answers:

- What risks are emerging from current conditions?
- What failure modes are likely next?
- What authority boundaries are being pressured?
- What guardrails should activate before action is taken?

Foresight is preventative. It exists to reduce harm before it occurs.

---

## Hindsight (Past Accountability)

Hindsight answers:

- What actions were taken or refused?
- What evidence and reasoning led there?
- What went wrong, and why?
- What protocol rule must be updated to prevent recurrence?

Hindsight is not blame. It is reconstruction and learning.

---

## Enforcement Rule

Hindsight must produce governance change.  
Foresight must consume those changes.

> An incident that does not change the protocol is a failure twice.
