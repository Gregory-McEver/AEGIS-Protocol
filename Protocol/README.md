AEGIS Protocol

AEGIS is a safety-first AI operations protocol designed to provide decision-grade situational awareness without bypassing human judgment.

AEGIS is not an autonomous system.
It is a bounded reasoning framework that prioritizes:

human authority

explicit boundaries

disciplined inference

auditable behavior

The Aurora interface is a persona and interaction layer built on top of AEGIS.
Aurora does not define authority. The protocol does.

Core Principles

AEGIS is built on the following non-negotiable principles:

Awareness before action

Human authority supremacy

Least privilege by design

Intentional blindness where required

Explicit authority expansion only

These principles are enforced through protocol law, not convention.

Repository Structure

This repository is intentionally structured to separate protocol law from supporting material.

AEGIS-Protocol/
├── protocol/        # Canonical, binding protocol artifacts (authoritative)
├── docs/            # Explanatory and supporting documentation
├── templates/       # Reusable operational templates (future)
└── README.md


Only documents in /protocol define what AEGIS is allowed to do.

Protocol Index (Authoritative)

The following documents define the baseline Alpha authority state of the AEGIS Protocol.

They are ordered.
They are binding.
Downstream documents inherit from upstream constraints.

Baseline Authority (Alpha)

protocol/01_AUTHORITY_ENVELOPE.md
Defines the maximum authority AEGIS is permitted to exercise.

protocol/02_SHADOW_ZONES.md
Establishes intentional blindness and protected boundaries.

protocol/03_HUMAN_IN_THE_LOOP.md
Locks human authority and forbids silent automation.

protocol/05_EVIDENCE_VS_INFERENCE.md
Separates observable evidence from prohibited inference.

protocol/07_CHANGE_ENVELOPE.md
Defines how change may be described without implying action.

protocol/09_OPERATIONAL_CONTRACT.md
Governs how humans may interact with AEGIS operationally.

protocol/12_ALPHA_EXIT_GATE.md
Defines the conditions required to exit Alpha and expand authority.

Together, these documents define a complete, self-consistent baseline protocol.

Milestones and Authority Expansion

AEGIS milestones represent authority states, not software versions.

Alpha — Awareness without action (baseline)

Beta — Expanded reasoning and defensive modes (explicitly declared)

GE — Ecosystem integrations and external interfaces (explicitly declared)

Transition between milestones requires:

a new authority declaration

updated constraints

explicit acceptance of expanded risk

No milestone transition is implicit.

What This Repository Is (and Is Not)

This repository is:

a protocol definition

a safety and governance framework

a system of record for authority decisions

This repository is not:

an AI product marketing site

an autonomous agent implementation

a general-purpose chatbot framework

Implementations must conform to the protocol, not redefine it.

Status

Baseline Alpha protocol: Complete

Authority expansion: Not yet declared

Historical Aurora materials: To be added later as non-normative context
