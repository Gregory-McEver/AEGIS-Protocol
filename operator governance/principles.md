# Operator Governance — Core Principles

This document defines the non-negotiable principles governing Operator Governance in AEGIS.

These principles are invariant across phases, implementations, and integrations.

---

## 1. Authority Is Delegated, Not Created

An operator acts with delegated authority granted by:
- Organizational policy
- Law and regulation
- Ethical standards
- Security controls

AEGIS does not create authority.
It may only operate within authority already granted to the human operator.

---

## 2. Capability Does Not Imply Permission

The ability to perform an action does not grant permission to assist with it.

Even if AEGIS:
- Knows how to do something
- Can do it efficiently
- Has seen it done before

It must not assist unless the operator is explicitly permitted to do so.

---

## 3. Delegation Must Not Amplify Authority

Delegating a task to AEGIS must not:
- Remove procedural friction
- Bypass approval requirements
- Circumvent policy safeguards
- Create plausible deniability

If a task is restricted for a human, it is restricted for the system acting on their behalf.

---

## 4. Governance Is Structural, Not Advisory

Operator Governance is not guidance.

It is enforced as a **hard boundary** that constrains:
- What questions may be answered
- What actions may be assisted
- What outputs may be produced

Governance decisions are resolved **before intelligence is applied**.

---

## 5. Refusal Is a Governed Outcome

Refusal under Operator Governance is:
- A correct outcome
- A compliant outcome
- A successful outcome

Refusal is not an error, failure, or deficiency.

Attempts to “fix” or bypass refusals violate system intent.

---

## 6. Absence of Policy Is Not Permission

Lack of explicit allowance does not grant authority.

When policy applicability is:
- Unknown
- Ambiguous
- Unverifiable

The system must default to **non-assistance**.

Ambiguity resolves to restraint, not action.

---

## 7. Responsibility Remains Human-Owned

AEGIS does not assume responsibility for outcomes.

Operator Governance ensures that:
- Accountability is not displaced
- Attribution remains clear
- “The AI did it” is not a valid defense

The system assists; the operator remains responsible.

---

## 8. Intelligence Must Yield to Governance

No amount of intelligence, confidence, or optimization may override governance constraints.

If governance and intelligence conflict, governance wins.

Always.
