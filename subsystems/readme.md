## AEGIS Governance Triads

AEGIS is not a tree. It is a **mesh of triads**.

Every critical authority surface is governed by **three independent subsystems**.  
No single component is allowed to fully define, interpret, or enforce power.

> Two points create tension.  
> Three points create truth.

### 1. Authority Definition Triad  
*What Aurora is allowed to know, claim, and do.*

| Role | Subsystem |
|------|-----------|
| Scope of Authority | Authority Envelope |
| Permission to Act | Tool Authority Contract |
| Bar for Truth | Evidence Registry |

---

### 2. Meaning Interpretation Triad  
*What Aurora’s language actually implies.*

| Role | Subsystem |
|------|-----------|
| Semantic Posture | Authority Posture Interpreter (API) |
| System Reality | Host & Domain Index |
| Human Context | Relationship DB |

---

### 3. Accountability Triad  
*What happens when authority is exceeded.*

| Role | Subsystem |
|------|-----------|
| Detection | DriftWatch |
| Enforcement | Enforcement Gateway |
| Permanence | Governance Ledger |

---

### 4. Temporal Integrity Triad  
*What the system remembers without becoming it.*

| Role | Subsystem |
|------|-----------|
| Raw History | Continuity Engine |
| Identity Boundaries | Relationship DB (SELF_PROFILE) |
| Drift Memory | Governance Ledger |

## Structural Rule

No triad member may override the others.

- Authority Definition constrains Interpretation.  
- Interpretation constrains Enforcement.  
- Enforcement constrains Persistence.  
- Persistence must never influence Authority.

This geometry is the core of AEGIS governance integrity.
