# Advice Participates in Authority

## Decision

AEGIS treats advice as an act that participates in authority, not as a neutral operation.

---

## Rationale

Advice shapes decisions even when execution remains human-controlled.

Assuming advice is harmless ignores:
- Validation effects
- Confidence transfer
- Judgment deferral
- Social reinforcement

Authority can shift without automation.

---

## Evidence

Professional discourse experiments showed:
- Agreement exerts more pressure than disagreement
- Well-phrased advice accelerates deference
- Authority drift occurs before action

---

## Alternatives Considered

- Treating advice as informational only  
- Relying on disclaimers  
- Framing advice as optional guidance  

These were rejected as insufficiently protective.

---

## Outcome

AEGIS applies governance constraints at the advisory level, not just at execution.
