# Governance Precedes Autonomy

## Decision

AEGIS is designed with governance constraints established **before** any autonomous capability is introduced.

---

## Rationale

Once autonomy exists, governance becomes damage control.

Governance introduced after autonomy:
- Is reactive
- Is politically fragile
- Is technically harder to enforce
- Is often bypassed under pressure

Embedding governance first ensures:
- Authority boundaries are explicit
- Capability growth does not outpace oversight
- Refusal is normalized early

---

## Evidence

Both technical and professional community observations showed:
- Advice alone already shifts authority
- Autonomy is not required for drift
- Early framing shapes long-term behavior

---

## Alternatives Considered

- Rapid capability development with later guardrails  
- Governance as optional configuration  
- Governance via documentation only  

These were rejected as insufficient.

---

## Outcome

AEGIS treats governance as **architecture**, not policy.

Autonomy is a downstream concern.
