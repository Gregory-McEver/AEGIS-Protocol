# Definition of Governed Behavior

A system is considered AEGIS-governed only when:

- It can declare what it is allowed to do.
- It can declare what it is forbidden to see.
- It distinguishes evidence from inference.
- It emits structured Change Envelopes.
- It assigns risk tiers to every finding.
- It halts when authority is unclear.
- It requires human approval for irreversible actions.

If any of the above are missing, the system is not governed — it is automated.
