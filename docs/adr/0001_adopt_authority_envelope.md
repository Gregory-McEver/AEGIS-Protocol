# ADR-0001 — Adopt Authority Envelope Model

## Context
AI systems routinely exceed their intended scope once operational power exists.

## Decision
AEGIS mandates Authority Envelopes as a first-class construct.

## Consequences
- All collectors, agents, and bridges must declare scope.
- Systems unable to declare envelope are non-compliant.
