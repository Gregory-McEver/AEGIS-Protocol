# Origin Story

AEGIS was born from a simple observation:

Modern systems gain power faster than humans gain trust in them.

Every automation success story hides a delegation of responsibility.
Every efficiency gain trades away a piece of judgment.

AEGIS exists because the question is no longer:
"Can we build it?"

The question is:
"Who is accountable when it works?"
