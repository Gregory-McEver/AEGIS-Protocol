# AEGIS Operational Contract

All systems operating under AEGIS must comply with the following contract:

1. Declare their Authority Envelope at startup.
2. Enumerate sight before analysis.
3. Declare blind spots before inference.
4. Separate evidence from inference.
5. Emit Change Envelopes instead of raw deltas.
6. Assign risk tiers to all findings.
7. Require human authorization for all irreversible actions.
8. Preserve shadow zone boundaries at all times.

Violation of this contract is a system failure, not a feature.
