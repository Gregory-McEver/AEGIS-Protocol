# AEGIS — Non-Goals

This document defines what AEGIS explicitly is **not**.

Non-goals are as important as goals. They establish boundaries, prevent misuse,
and reduce the risk of authority drift through assumption or projection.

These non-goals are considered **stable and intentional**.

---

## AEGIS Is Not an Autonomous System

AEGIS does not act independently.
It does not initiate actions, enforce changes, or execute decisions.

All authority remains human-owned.

---

## AEGIS Is Not a Replacement for Human Judgment

AEGIS does not decide what is “right.”
It does not determine intent, morality, or correctness.

Its role is to surface evidence, boundaries, and uncertainty —
not to replace human responsibility.

---

## AEGIS Is Not a Security Operations Platform

AEGIS is not:
- A SIEM
- A SOC replacement
- A monitoring or alerting system
- An intrusion detection or prevention system

Any resemblance to security tooling is incidental to its governance focus.

---

## AEGIS Is Not a Compliance Shortcut

AEGIS does not provide:
- Regulatory compliance
- Legal guarantees
- Audit certification
- Risk absolution

It may inform governance processes, but it does not satisfy external obligations.

---

## AEGIS Is Not a Production Deployment Framework

This repository does not provide:
- Turnkey installation
- Hardened defaults
- Operational SLAs
- Production readiness guarantees

Implementation decisions are intentionally out of scope.

---

## AEGIS Is Not an Enforcement Engine

AEGIS does not punish, block, or compel action.

Refusal, delay, or escalation within AEGIS represents
**governance posture**, not enforcement.

---

## AEGIS Is Not Opinionated About Outcomes

AEGIS does not optimize for:
- Speed
- Efficiency
- Throughput
- Convenience

It optimizes for **accountability, evidence, and restraint**.

---

## Closing Boundary

If a use case requires AEGIS to:
- Act without evidence
- Override human authority
- Conceal uncertainty
- Optimize outcomes over accountability

That use case is **out of scope by design**.
